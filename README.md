# Rent Price Index (Spain)

This Python script creates different MySQL tables with public data, from the Spanish Ministry of Transportation, Mobility and Urban Agenda, related with the rent price of homes in Spain (at different administrative levels). Those tables simplify the advanced querying of data. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python libraries used

* os
* decouple
* requests

password = 'pwd' # replace with your password
ipaddress = 'localhost' # change this to your dbâ€™s IP address
port = 3306 # this is the standard port for MySQL, but change it to your port if needed

```


## Usage
